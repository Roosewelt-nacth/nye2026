🎩 Victorians Youth: Digital Chronicle 2026
Bridging the 19th and 21st Centuries
Welcome to the official repository for the Victorians Youth Group New Year's Eve Act. This project is a mobile-responsive, interactive web experience designed for an audience to engage with during a live performance.

🌟 The Concept
During our New Year's Eve act, the audience is invited to scan a QR code that transports them to a "Digital Telegraph." As we transition from 2025 into 2026, the website serves as a medium for:

The Final Farewell: A dramatic goodbye to the past year.

The 2026 Revelation: An immersive, animated welcome to the New Year.

Personalized Blessings: A random Bible verse generator (100+ verses) to provide hope and guidance for every individual in the audience.

🛠️ Features
UX-Focused Design: Built with a "Mobile-First" approach, ensuring the Victorian Youth logo and core content are perfectly balanced for smartphone screens.

Glassmorphism UI: High-end "frosted glass" effects that maintain text legibility over vibrant, moving backgrounds.

Dynamic Animations: * Vibrant Gradient Background: A shifting nebula of purple, blue, and black.

Glitter & Crackers: Semi-transparent "glitter" confetti and central "cracker burst" animations that celebrate without obscuring the text.

Interactive Randomizer: A JavaScript-powered engine that selects a unique verse for every user.

Social Integration: Direct links to the Victorian Youth Instagram page.
